# Project Overview: Simple Calculator
**Objective:**
The objective of this project is to create a simple console-based calculator application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The program aims to provide a user-friendly experience while demonstrating fundamental programming concepts in Java.

**Key Features:**
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Input Validation: Handles invalid inputs gracefully, ensuring robust user interaction.
Error Handling: Prevents division by zero and prompts users with appropriate messages for incorrect operations.
User Interaction: Engages users with clear prompts and the option to perform multiple calculations in one session.
Modular Design: Uses methods to separate calculation logic from user input, improving code readability and maintainability.
# Technologies Used
Java: The primary programming language used to develop the calculator application.
Java Util Package: Utilized for the Scanner class to handle user input from the console.

The program uses a switch statement to perform the operation based on the user-selected operator:
Addition (+): Adds the two numbers and displays the result.
Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second number from the first and displays the result.
Multiplication (*): Multiplies the two numbers and displays the result.
Division (/): Divides the first number by the second, with a check to prevent division by zero. If the second number is zero, it displays an error message.
Default case: If an invalid operator is entered, it prompts the user to enter a correct option.

 # Future Enhancements:
Advanced Operations: Incorporate more complex mathematical functions such as exponentiation and square roots.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Develop a GUI version using Java Swing or JavaFX for a more interactive user experience.
Unit Testing: Implement automated tests to verify the correctness of calculations and handle edge cases.
Feel free to modify any sections to better fit your vision for the project! Let me know if you need further assistance.
# CODETECH TASK-2

# project overview :Student grade and GPA calculator
This project is a console-based Java application designed to assist students in calculating their academic performance metrics, including average grades, overall letter grades, and GPAs. The application allows users to input grades for a specified number of subjects, perform calculations, and display results in a clear and organized format.
users can specify the number of subjects and enter grades for each one.
**Average Calculation:**  The program computes the average grade based on the input.
**Letter Grade Determination:** It categorizes the average into an overall letter grade (A, B, C, D, F).
**GPA Calculation:** The application calculates the GPA using a standard 4.0 scale.
**Input Validation:** Ensures that the entered grades are within a valid range (0-100).
**Formatted Output:** Displays results clearly, including the average grade, overall letter grade, and GPA.
## Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Java
Development Environment: Compatible with any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans).
Input Handling: Utilizes the Scanner class for user input.
Benefits:
This project serves as an educational tool for students to better understand their academic performance. It emphasizes essential programming concepts such as user input handling, loops, conditionals, and method creation in Java. The implementation of validation checks makes the application robust and user-friendly.
## Future Improvements:
Potential enhancements could include:
Developing a graphical user interface (GUI) for improved user interaction.
Implementing data persistence to save and retrieve student records.
Adding options for different grading scales or weighted GPAs based on credit hours.
Feel free to explore the code and contribute to further developments!
